I am a Master of Engineering student at Cornell University. My interests lies deeply in the fields of Information/Control Theory, Machine Learning, and Finance Risk Assessment.

My hometown is Shenyang, China. I lived in Fukuoka, Japan for almost 2 year when I was young. My family
moved to Connecticut for a few years, and now I live in Ithaca, NY. I love meeting people from different cultural and geographic backgrounds. I am looking forward to more adventures in the future!
